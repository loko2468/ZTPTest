The task:

*An excel file “EnergyConsumptionDetails.xlsx” is provided containing the energy consumption and price details of a certain number of customers. You will find the consumption detail for each customer on the respective sheet (“Customer X”). The “Rate Price” sheet contains the unit price details for the individual rates. The “Example” sheet explains all the information you need for your calculations.*

*1.1 Limited to the technologies outlined below, build a Django project to read the customer details from the excel file and render an html page that displays the customers’ personal and consumption details in a table format.*

*1.2 Add a button to the html page to implement a Django form which when clicked, will show the following details in a table format: • Details of the customer with the highest ‘Day Rate’ consumption. • Details of the customer with the highest ‘Night Rate’ consumption. • Details of the customer with the highest ‘Total Energy Cost’.*

*How you display the data in tables and whether you want to use single or multiple tables, is totally up to you as long as it makes sense.*

*Technologies: Django 2.2, Python 3.7, HTML, CSS, JavaScript.*
